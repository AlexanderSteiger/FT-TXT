-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This is a list of features we would like to implement in versions to come with descending priority:  |
| [M] means Modification (instead of addition)                                                         |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--basos hi priority list--

* NEW On wireless settings show channel list to choose
* NEW On wireless settings add key support, calls to deal with WPA also
* Document Register Router for local router (after i18n intergration)
* SEC, Make POST ACTIONS for DHCP, Delete Route
* [LOW] Add WPA association support
* Interpret route flags (dynamic, with gateway, host up)

--cleaning--
* Check usability for early gui update (after a status change)
* is traffic graph working (rrds seem to be updated)?
* WIP [LOW] Refactor i18n with gettext
	DONE: index.php, confirm_account.php, copying.php, forgotpassword.php, ifsettings.php, install.php, iwsecurity.php

--other--
* Confirmation email test
* Test iwsettings all cases
* Show Clearer warning or error msgs on AP ACL stuff acting on *madwifi* devs
* Redesign Privilege system. ACL per device . Admin cannot loose assign_privileged privilege (egg and chicken circle)
* Extend RealTime Graphs (signal)
* Manage the creation of madwifi pseudo devices (Create ap,sta,ad-hoc device - verify the creation, destroy the devs
* Add the ability of automatic graphics cron job creation
* Put overlib descriptive pop ups

-- SciFi (for now) but wanted--
* Design and Implement a security mechanism to avoid sudoing the apache user.. Verify that it is possible and has meaning. e.g. on a possible apache user compromize we might be in danger from other places as well (sql auth?). (daemon,... ? or wrapper app that will run as another secure user and will execute sudo apps. It should do user authentication as well to avoid a compromised apache user to be able to execute sudo programs)
* Possibly Make configuration persistent after reboot (ifup/ifdown /etc/network ... )
* Configure DHCP SERVER (pools,listening addresses, static ips.... file parsing OR is there a nice app??)

--- OLD TODOS/ LOW PRI ---
* [M] !Footer must contain wifimaster contact form or email!
* Dynamic routing configuration. One more page to configure quagga routing
  deamon
* Set an average signal level Threshold/Tolerance for the master mode devices [Sum(signalofeveryuser)/#ofusers].
  If the average signal drops below threshold, do something (highligh assosiation or kick low signal users (evil;).
* Make user management useful
  One mysql table with MACs - IPs and each user having multiple such tuples
  MAC address guessing (through ping and arp) while inserting a new machine
  dns entry editing for each user's ip (static ip scheme)
